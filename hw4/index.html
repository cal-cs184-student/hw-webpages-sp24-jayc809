    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <div>
      In this project, we will implement various components of a
      physically-based cloth simulation. We will start with constructing the
      actual cloth using a mass-and-spring system to track the positions,
      movements, internal contraining forces, and geometries of the cloth over
      the course of our simulation. Next, we will lay the foundation of our
      simulation by constructing the framework for how each point mass responds
      to external and internal forces between each time step using Verlet
      integration. Then, we will implement collisions with both external objects
      and the cloth itself by detecting collisions and correcting the point mass
      positions in an efficient manner. Lastly, we will implement various
      shaders using GLSL, allowing us to render different visual effects in
      real-time by utilizing the GPU.
    </div>
    <br />
    <h3>Part 1: Masses and springs</h3>
    <div>
      In preparation for our simulation, we will first create the cloth. Here,
      we use a simple mass-and-spring system, where upon intialization, the
      cloth is represented by
      <code>num_width_points</code> by <code>num_height_points</code> point
      masses spaced evenly across the planar surface. in other words, we divide
      our cloth into a grid, where each vertex is responsible the behavior
      (position, acting forces, etc.) of its respective region, and altogether
      simulates how the entire cloth behaves. Springs, on the other hand,
      connects point masses with each other and essentially describes how the
      cloth is held together and contrains its motion. For each point mass at
      grid position <code>(r, c)</code>, we have three types of spring
      contraints: 1. Structural, which exists between <code>(r, c)</code> and
      <code>[(r-1, c), (r, c-1)]</code>, describes the positional ordering of
      point masses relative to their neighbors. 2. Shearing, which exists
      between <code>(r, c)</code> and <code>[(r-1, c-1), (r-1, c+1)]</code>,
      limits how much point masses and shapes can collapse and deform. 3.
      Bending, which exists between <code>(r, c)</code> and
      <code>[(r-2, c), (r, c-2)]</code>, characterizes how our cloth can bend
      and fold.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      As for the implementation, it is quite straightforward as we simply create
      three for loops. The first one loops over the grid, calculates the
      numerical width and height coordinates of the point mass, determines its
      position based on the orientaion of the scene, and appends its to the
      vector of point masses. The second loops over the pinned vector and sets
      the <code>pinned</code> property of each pinned mass to true. Lastly, the
      third loop loops over the point masses, creates all appropriate
      structural, shearing, and bending springs according to the aforementioned
      rules, and appends them to the vector of springs.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      As shown below, we can see the mass-and-spring system in action, where the
      cloth is composed of a grid of point masses connected by springs.
    </div>
    <br />
    <img src="images/1-1.png" style="max-height: 500px; max-width: 600px" />
    <br />
    <br />
    <div>
      Furthermore, we can see that the spring constraints are applied correctly.
      Since shearing is only applied to the two upper diagonal point masses, we
      see that when we disable shearing, we no longer have any diagonal lines
      and only have horizontal and vertical lines. Similarly, since structural
      and bending are applied to the point masses directly to top and left
      directions with distances 1 and 2 respectively, we expect that when we
      diasble them and only allow shearing, we should only see diagonal lines.
      Of course, when we enable all three constraints, our cloth has both
      diagonal, horizontal, and vertical lines.

    <br />
    <h3>Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h3>
    <div>
      In this part we will implement and simulate physical motion. Our basic
      structure is as follows: For each simulation timestep, we calculate the
      combined forces acting on each point mass, apply various constraints, and
      derive its new position. When we repeat this process across all timesteps,
      we will be able to simulate how the cloth's geometry changes and develops.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      There are two categories of forces acting on our point masses - external
      forces, which accounts for gravity and collisions, as well as spring
      correction forces, which accounts for the internal bounding force that
      holds the cloth together in one piece. Therefore, to calculate the total
      force for each point mass, we simply sum up all external and spring
      correction force vectors, which are derived using Newton's second law of
      motion and Hook's law respectively.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      Next, to estimate how the position of point masses changes after being
      affected by the combined force in each time step, we will use Verlet
      integration. We first start with kinematics motion, where given an objects
      current position, velocity, and acceleration, we can determine its final
      position over some time step <code>dt</code> using
      <p>
        <img src="images/2-1.png" style="max-height: 300px; max-width: 400px" />
      </p>
      , which can be modified to
      <p>
        <img src="images/2-2.png" style="max-height: 300px; max-width: 400px" />
      </p>
      after approximating the displacement due to velocity with the total
      displacemnet of the previous time step scaled by a factor <code>d</code>,
      which accounts for damping due to friction and other energy losses. Using
      this equation, as well as the point mass data structure that supplies its
      various required variables (where the acceleration can be derived from
      <code>pm.forces / mass</code>), we can now estimate the new position of
      each point mass.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      Finally, we apply one last constraint in our motion simulation, the
      deformation constraint, which limits our springs to a maximum length of
      1.1 times the resting length. In other words, by ensuring that springs
      will never be stretched beyond a certain extent, we prevent our point
      masses from ever displacing too much away from each other and consequently
      our cloth from losing its shape. This is relatively simple to implement,
      for each spring, if the distance between its two point masses exceeds 1.1
      times its resting length, we calculate the correction vector using the
      length to be deducted multiplied by the direction from one point mass to
      the other. We then simply apply the correction vector evenly among the two
      point masses (and account for the reverse direction appropriately), unless
      one of the two is pinned, in which case we apply the entire correction to
      the unpinned one.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      As shown below in the demonstation, we see that we can now succesfully and
      accurately simulate the fall of a cloth that has two of its corners pinned
      in the air (<code>scene/pinned2.json</code>)

    <div>
      We can also compare how different parameters affect the simulation. For
      example, since the spring constant <code>ks</code> is positively related
      to the spring correction force, when we have a high <code>ks</code>, we
      expect more of a contracting effect on the cloth. In other words, the
      cloth should look tighter and would be as if it was made out of some sort
      of tight, stretchy polyester. On the other hand, when we have a low
      <code>ks</code>, our point masses would have less force bounding them
      together, which would result in a looser, silky cloth with more drape.
      Below is the result of comparing <code>ks</code>'s of 1000, 5000
      (default), and 10000 N/m.

    <br />
    <br />
    <div>
      We can see very clearly in this frame how a lower <code>ks</code> (left)
      results in a looser, droopier cloth whereas a higher constant (right)
      results in one that is tighter and firmer.
    </div>

    <br />
    <br />
    <div>
      We can also compare the effects of changing the density of the cloth.
      Since the mass of each point mass is derived from the density parameter,
      at a higher density, the same force would correspond to less acceleration,
      which over the Verlet integration, leads to less displacement. We see this
      effect in the final swinging stages of the falling cloth where after the
      initial fall, upon close inspection we can see that the denser cloth takes
      fewer swings of smaller magnitudes to settle and reach the resting
      position. Below is the result of comparing densities of 1, 15 (default),
      and 50 g/cm^2.

    ></iframe>
    <br />
    <br />
    <div>
      Although the swing effect is easier to see from the video, we can also see
      that at rest, the denser cloth (right) also droops more and have greater
      folds due to having the heavier unpinned center region hanging while the
      cloth with a lower density (left) appears lighter and have a less
      noticeable center "U-shape".
    </div>
    <br />
    <img src="images/2-7.png" style="max-height: 300px; max-width: 1200px" />
    <br />
    <br />
    <div>
      Lastly, we can compare the results of changing the damping parameter,
      which essentially measures how quickly velocity terminates due to friction
      and other energy loss such as air resistance. In other words, since
      damping is inversely proportional to the displacement due to velocity as
      per the Verlet integration, it is expected that a lower damping will
      result in higher velocity, less energy loss, and consequently more
      back-and-forth rapid motions before reaching the terminal state, as shown
      in the more intense swinging and wobbling motion of the cloth. In
      contrast, a higher damping will "damp" more motion, resulting in less
      momentum (<code>p = mv</code>) as well as a slower, less intense path and
      fewer swings to rest. Below is the comparison between damping paramters of
      0.07, 0.2 (default), and 0.4 percent.

    ></iframe>
    <br />
    <br />
    <div>
      We can see very clearly in this frame that at the same time step, the
      lowest damping cloth (left) has already completed the initial swing and is
      on its way to the second, "reverse" swing while the highest damping
      (right) is barely halfway through its first and only swing. We can also
      see the difference in velocity and momentum in the flat and foldless
      surface of the latter compared to the erratic and irregular surface of
      former.
    </div>
    <br />
    <img src="images/2-8.png" style="max-height: 300px; max-width: 1200px" />
    <br />
    <br />
    <div>
      Finally, we can also see what setting various parameters to extreme
      values, such as zero, would do. When the spring constant is zero, it
      essentially means that there will be no force due to spring contraction,
      and our cloth would be very loose as shown below. For density at zero, the
      cloth simply would not render as there is no mass. Lastly, when damping
      equals zero, there is very little resistance and the pendulum motion goes
      on for very long without losing much energy during each swing.

    <h3>Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h3>
    <div>
      Next, we will implement collisions, which essentially boils down to
      detecting when a point mass intersects with another object and correcting
      its position to prevent the point mass from phasing through the object. We
      will be implementing collisions for both the sphere and plane classes.
      Despite their different geometries, the collision logic is more or less
      the same involving 3 main steps: 1. Checking if a collision occurred 2. If
      so, find the tangent point on the object's surface at which the point mass
      should've intersected with and put to a stop 3. Apply the correction
      vector, scaled by some friction constant <code>f</code>, to the point
      mass's last position to bring its new position to the tangent point. Since
      only steps 1 and 2 differ for each class, I will only explain them in
      detail below.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      For the sphere class, we will detect collisions by checking if the
      distance between the point mass and sphere origin is less than or equal to
      its radius. If so, we have a collision and will then calculate the tangent
      point by extending a distance equal to the radius from the origin towards
      the point mass position, thereby ensuring that the tangent point will
      always be on the surface of the sphere.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      For the plane class, we will detect collisions by checking if the point
      mass's position and last position are on opposite sides of the plane or if
      one of them lies perfectly on the plane. Both scenarios intuitively imply
      an intersection between the point mass's path and the plane. We can
      determine which side a point is relative to the plane by using the formula
      <code
        >d = N.x * (p.x - p'.x) + N.y * (p.y - p'.y) + N.z * (p.z - p'.z)</code
      >, where <code>N</code> represents the surface normal of the plane,
      <code>p'</code> a point that lies on the plane, and <code>p</code> the
      point to test. <code>d</code> is then the distance from the point to the
      plane, and its sign tells us which side it is relative to the surface
      normal vector, where a positive <code>d</code> implies that the point is
      on the side that <code>N</code> points to, and vice versa. Lastly, to
      calculate the tangent point, we add <code>-(d * N)</code> to the position
      of the point mass and add a small surface offset to ensure that the
      tangent point is not inside the plane and is ron the same side as the last
      position.

      We can now simulate how the cloth falls onto and interacts with a sphere.
      Here is the comparison between <code>ks=500</code>,

    <div>
      We can see the effect of different spring constants at each resting state.
      Since <code>ks</code> is directly related to the magnitude of the spring
      correction force, a lower <code>ks</code> (leftmost image) would result in
      a weaker internal force that holds and fixes the cloth in place, which
      allows the to stretch, droop, and deform more. On the other hand, a higher
      <code>ks</code> (rightmost image) would result in a strong spring
      correction force, which results in a stiffer, harder, and more rigid
      cloth.

    <h3>Part 4: Handling self-collisions</h3>
    <div>
      We will now implement self-collisions, which in essence, prevents our
      cloth from collapsing and phasing through itself. The idea is quite
      straightforward, at each simulation time step, we want to ensure that no
      two point masses are too close to each other. A simple solution would be
      to check every point mass against every other one, and if the pair are to
      close, adjust their positions and move them apart. However, this would
      result in a O(n^2) algorithm, which is too slow given the target frame
      rate. We will instead implement an ideally amortized linear algorithm,
      where we use a hashmap to store point masses in the same general
      space/area indexed by the hash of their box volume. This way, we can check
      for collisions quickly by minimizing the scope of our search to just the
      point masses near our target.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      First, we need to be able to derive the box volume hash given a point
      mass. To do this, we essentially divide our space into a 3D grid,
      determine which grid box the point is in, and create a more or less unique
      number based on the ordering of the grid box. Since each grid box has the
      dimentions <code>(w, h, t)</code>, where
      <code>w = 3 * width / num_width_points</code>,
      <code>h = 3 * height / num_height_points</code>, and
      <code>t = max(w, h)</code>, we can find the point mass's box index along
      each dimension (i.e. the "left" grid line or floor value of the box) via
      <code>[w, h, t]_index = [x, y, z] - fmod([x, y, z], [w, h, t])</code>.
      Lastly, we compute the hash by multiplying each index by a different large
      prime and sum the results up to minimize hash collisions between different
      boxes.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      Now that we can hash a point mass position, we simply go through the list
      of point masses and place them in the correct bin during each simulation
      step to set up our spatial map. Next, we look for collisions by checking
      if each point mass has any same-box neighbors that are too close. If so,
      like what we have done in the previous parts, we calculate the correction
      vector needed to move the point mass far away enough from its neighbor and
      update its position accrodingly. If there are multiple neighbors that are
      too close, we apply the average correction.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      As shown below, our cloth can now fold, twist, and bend in a realistic
      manner without ever phasing through or clipping itself.

      Furthermore, we can also compare how varying the spring constant
      <code>ks</code> affects the simulation. Here is the result of setting
      <code>ks</code> to 500, 5000 (default), and 50000 N/m.

    <br />
    <div>
      Like we have explained many times in the previous sections, when the
      spring constant is lowered, the cloth becomes less constrained and rigid,
      which consequently gives it a floppy feel. As we can see from the left
      image, when the cloth is dropped, it crumbles into itself, folds and
      twists in an unpredictable manner, and produces many unstructured
      protrusions. In constrast, a high <code>ks</code> results in a harder,
      less flexible cloth as the internal straining forces become stronger. As
      we can see in the right image, the cloth keeps its shape more and is much
      less bendable, as indicated by the lack of folds in the z direction,
      folding firmly instead of crumbling loosely.

    <div>
      We can see from the comparison in this frame that increasing the density
      almost has an inverse effect to the simulation compared to increasing the
      spring constant. We see in the high density cloth (right) that the
      movement of each point mass is less affected by the spring correction
      forces, which results in the cloth deforming and collapsing into a very
      concentrated, central area of folds and remains entangled for a long time.
      On the other hand, due to the relatively-stronger influence of spring
      cosntraints, the lower density cloth (left) keeps its shape, unfolds
      itself much more linearly, and spreads and flattens its folds more
      efficiently and quickly.

    <h3>Part 5: Cloth Sim</h3>
    <div>
      In this section, we will be implementing shaders using GLSL, which allows
      high-speed, real-time rendering of our simulation by utilizing the GPU.
      There are two main components in a shading pipeline, a vertex shader
      followed by a fragment shader. The former is responsible for deriving
      various values for each vertex, such as its position and surface normal in
      world space as well as its render position in image space. These data are
      then piped into the fragment shader, which then calculates the final
      output color to be rendered on screen.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      The first shader we will implement is the diffuse shader, and since it
      simply diffuses the light on our vertices and does not change their
      positions, we only need to modify the fragment shader. Given the position
      and intensity of the point light in the scene, as well as the data from
      the default vertex shader, we can use this equation to derive its color.
    </div>
    <br />
    <img src="images/5-1.png" style="max-height: 100px; max-width: 300px" />
    <br />
    <br />
    <div>And end up with a render like this:</div>
    <br />
    <div style="display: flex">
      <img src="images/5-2.png" style="max-height: 300px; max-width: 400px" />
      <img src="images/5-3.png" style="max-height: 300px; max-width: 400px" />
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      Next, we will implement the Blinn-Phong shader, which, similar to the
      diffuse shader, will also only require modifying the fragment shader. The
      improved realism is due to a more complex output color composed of three
      terms: the ambient, diffuse, and specular components. The ambient light
      simulates how light bounces and scatters around the environment and
      provides the base color layer for each object. The diffuse light is
      essentially just the diffuse shader from the previous part, scattering
      incoming light evenly in all directions and giving a matte finish to the
      surfaces. Lastly, the specular light captures the shiny reflections
      concentrated towards the camera, resembling the light reflecting off
      metallic and mirror surfaces. The three terms are described mathematically
      with the equation below, respectively.

    <br />

      In my implementation, I set <code>ka=0.1</code>, <code>kd=0.6</code>,
      <code>ks=1</code>, <code>Ia=(1, 1, 1)</code>, and <code>p=10</code>,
      resulting in a render like this:

    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      Since the vertex shader also provides us with the uv-coordinate of each
      vertex in texture space, we can also easily map any texture onto our cloth
      by setting the output color of the fragment shader to the sampling result
      of any given texture at <code>(u, v)</code>.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div style="display: flex">
      <img src="images/5-13.png" style="max-height: 300px; max-width: 400px" />
      <img src="images/5-14.png" style="max-height: 300px; max-width: 400px" />
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      Next, we will implement bump mapping, which is a process that allows for
      complex surface height variations without increasing the complexity of the
      mesh. In essence, suppose we want to give the cloth a sand-paper-like
      surface with many little particles and bumps. In order to create this
      material, we must then increase the number of vertices to create each peak
      and trough, which is obviously very inefficient since the general shape
      and behavior of the cloth has not changed. Therefore, we can use bump
      mapping to create an illusion of such bumpy materials in the shading part
      of the rendering pipeline instead of the simulation part and use the same
      underlying perfectly-smooth mesh. Given a height map, as well as the
      function
      <code>h(u, v)</code> that essentially returns the desired height of the
      object's surface at <code>(u, v)</code> on the height map, we can caculate
      <code>dU</code> and <code>dV</code> using the formula
    </div>
    <br />
    <img src="images/5-25.png" style="max-height: 100px; max-width: 500px" />
    <br />
    <br />
    <div>
      Allowing us to derive the local-space "bumped" surface normal
      <code>no</code> as <code>(-dU, -dV, 1)</code>. Using the
      tangent-bitangent-normal (TBN) matrix, we can then transform
      <code>no</code> to <code>nd</code>, giving us the "bumped" surface normal
      in model space. We then input the modified surface normal back to the
      Blinn-Phong shader to achieve a realistic and efficient bump texture
      mapping as shown below.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div style="display: flex">

      Of course, we can see that although bump mapping does give us the illusion
      of these height varying textures, when we view the cloth from the side, we
      still don't see any actual physical bumps. Therefore, we will now move to
      displacement mapping, which builds on top of the fragment shader of bump
      mapping and additionally displaces the vertex positions in the vertex
      shader using

      To create real, physical bumps as shown below in the caved-in mortar
      layers between the bricks on the surfaces of the sphere and cloth.

      We can also see how coarseness of the sphere mesh affects the
      effectiveness of displacement mapping. For example, we can see that the
      16x16 sphere has more of a polygon look and is missing the caved-in
      structures of the mortar layers between the bricks compared to the 128x128
      sphere. This is most likely due to the fact that since displacement occurs
      at each vertex, more coarse and consequently fewer vertices leads to a
      lower probability of the vertex being at the position of a bump. In other
      words, since there are only 16 vertices around the circumference, there is
      a good chance that none of them accounted for the mortar displacements.
      Similarly, for the bump mapping, we see that the 16x16 sphere is also more
      polygonic then the 128x128 one with visible sharper corners. Obviously
      since bump mapping does not modify vertex positions, we do not see any
      differences in the displacement of the geometry of the spheres.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      Finally, we implement environment-mapped reflections, where we simply
      treat the surface of our objects as mirrors. The idea is simple, since
      everything we "see" must have bounced off an object and went into the
      camera, we can simply reverse this to trace and derive the "source light".
      In practice, given the ray vector <code>wo</code> from the camera to a
      vertex, we use the surface normal of said vertex to reflect and determine
      the source ray <code>wi</code>. We can then use <code>wi</code> to sample
      the cubemap texture, allowing us to see the reflections of our surrounding
      environment like a mirror.
