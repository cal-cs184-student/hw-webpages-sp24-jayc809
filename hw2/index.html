    <h3>Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision (10 pts)</h3>
    <div>
      The goal of this part is to derive each level of a Bezier curve using the
      de Casteljau subdivision algorithm. The idea is very simple, for a curve
      with n control points, we should have n levels each corresponding to their
      respective number of points. In other words, the last level would have
      just one point - the coordinate of the curve at parameter t. The recursive
      subdivision step is quite simple to implement as well, for each pair of
      consecutive points, we linearly interpolate their values using t and add
      the result to the returned list.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      As we can see below in the first example, the algorithm correctly
      calculates the points at each level, creating the smooth curve specified
      by the control points. In the second example, we can see how the parameter
      t influences the linear interpolation at each level.

    <h3>Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau (15 pts)</h3>
    <div>
      We now shift our focus to generating Bezier surfaces to view 3D models.
      The concept behind Bezier surfaces is almost identical to Bezier curves,
      only that instead of performing recursive subdivision on just one
      dimension over paramter t, we now do it across two dimensions over
      parameters u and v. In practice, given an n by n matrix of control points,
      we 1. perform de Casteljau with parameter u over the inner dimension,
      attaining n points along the "u axis", and then 2. interpolate with
      parameter v over the n points from step 1, attaining the single point
      along the "v axis" specified by parameters (u, v).

    </div>
    <br />
    <h3>Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals (10 pts)</h3>
    <div>
      We can see that flat shading results in models that have noticeable edges,
      varying color patches, and unsmooth transitions between faces. We will
      improve this via Phong shading, where we attempt to simulate how light
      reflects off of each vertex. In order to estimate the normal of a vertex
      (and subsequently how it interacts with light), we will take the
      area-weighted sum of the normals of its neighboring faces. This makes
      sense conceptually as the bigger flat-ish geometry of a curved surface
      would probably have more influence on the overall reflection compared to a
      smaller section. My implementation follows the general structure provided
      in the spec where I 1. loop over each triangle connected to the vertex, 2.
      find the positions of its three vertices by looping over each edge, 3.
      calculate its normal and area, and 4. taking the weighted sum of the
      normal across all triangles.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      As we can see below, the model using Phong shading appears much smoother
      than that using flat shading.

    <br />
    <h3>Part 4: Edge Flip (15 pts)</h3>
    <div>
      For this section, we implement edge flip, which basically allows us to
      change the orientation of the connecting edge between two triangles. The
      algorithm is not particularly complicated, but is quite hard to explain.
      Therefore, I created the graphic below so that the explanation can be a
      bit simpler. The basic idea is to represent any pair of adjacent triangles
      and their common edge by the left diagram. The position, orientation,
      shape of the actual triangles don't really matter too much since the neat
      part about using the half edge data structure is that every element
      (vertex, edge, face) can be deterministically ordered and accessed
      relative to one another. Our goal essentially is to go from the left
      diagram to the right. This is straightforward as we simply reassign the
      pointers for each relevant element and half edge. For example, in order to
      modify
      <code>Hb</code> into <code>Ha</code>, we need to change its vertex from
      <code>Vb</code> to <code>Va</code> as well as its next half edge from
      <code>H0c</code> to <code>H1d</code> as shown below.
    </div>
    <br />
    <img src="images/4-3.png" style="max-height: 400px; max-width: 600px" />
    <br />
    <div>
      Before implementation, I followed the spec and drew a detailed diagram
      (similar to the one above) of how everything needs to change and made sure
      that I am familiar with the different data structures. Therefore, the
      process was smooth and I didn't have to do too much debugging.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      We can see that from the results below that I was able to create a nice
      zig-zag pattern by flipping certain edges.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div style="display: flex">

      <img src="images/4-2.png" style="max-height: 400px; max-width: 600px" />
    </div>
    <br />
    <h3>Part 5: Edge Split (15 pts)</h3>
    <div>
      In this part we implement edge split. Given an edge of a pair of adjacent
      triangles, we wish to split the edge with a new vertex and create four
      triangles out of it. The general idea is more or less the same as the
      previous part, where we redirect pointers and modify properties of
      relevant elements. However, there is one difference being that we now need
      to create additional elements as well. As shown below in cyan, we need to
      create one new vertex, two new faces, three new edges, and six new half
      edges. Moreover, we also need to reuse certain elements like we did in the
      previous part. As shown in the pairs of same color labels between the left
      and right diagrams (green, orange, red, purple, blue), we also need to
      reassign the pointers for one edge, two faces, and two half edges.
    </div>
    <img src="images/5-5.png" style="max-height: 400px; max-width: 600px" />
    <br />
    <div>
      Similar to before, I sketched out a diagram before implementing the
      feature and was very careful with every line of code. As a result, I
      didn't really have too many bugs. The only issue I had was that I forgot
      to set the position of the new vertex <code>Vm</code>, which was very
      easily identified.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      We can now successfully split an edge and create complex surfaces. The
      edge split and edge flip functionalities also work well together and can
      complement each other to create even more complex shapes and surfaces.

    </div>
    <br />
    <h3>Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling (25 pts)</h3>
    <div>
      Finally, we implement mesh upsampling via loop subdivision. The idea is
      simple, we improve the coarseness of a mesh by adding interpolated
      vertices between existing ones. Specifically, we want to split each face
      into four triangles. I followed the algorithm suggested by the skeleton
      code for this task. First, we compute the new positions for both exisiting
      and new vertices after upsampling according to the formulas explained in
      the spec and store them into theor respective data structures. Then, we
      perform the 4-1 subdivision by first splitting every existing edge and
      then flipping every new edge that connects an existing to a new vertex
      using the functions we implemented earlier. Finally, we assign each vertex
      to its precalculated new position.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      Of course, many bugs came up during the implementation stage. For example,
      I realized that I have implemented the edge flip and edge split
      functionalities incorrectly, where I erroneously assigned the half edge of
      each vertex to its original value (i.e. implicitly no change) as opposed
      to explicitly setting it to one of its connected edges. This bug was
      discovered because after the first three or so upsampling, although the
      general shape of the mesh is correct, there would be certain areas
      protruding or caving in. I suspect this is due to the fact that after a
      split or flip, there is a chance that the vertex's original edge would end
      up on another vertex, which is why the issue seemingly only shows up at
      random places and would worsen over time. Another issue was that I forgot
      to set the
      <code>isNew</code> flag on the newly created elements, which made
      discerning a new/existing edge impossible. Finally, one other bug was that
      instead of setting <code>isNew</code> to <code>false</code>, I ended up
      overwriting the previously modified <code>newPosition</code> to
      <code>false</code>. This was a hard bug to find as I couldn't figure out
      why my vertices were collapsing to <code>(0, 0, 0)</code>.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      The results of upsampling is shown below. We can see that my results for
      the cube and icosahedron both match the expectations.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div style="display: flex">
      <img src="images/6-1.png" style="max-height: 200px; max-width: 300px" />
      <img src="images/6-2.png" style="max-height: 200px; max-width: 300px" />
      <img src="images/6-3.png" style="max-height: 200px; max-width: 300px" />
      <img src="images/6-4.png" style="max-height: 200px; max-width: 300px" />
      <img src="images/6-5.png" style="max-height: 200px; max-width: 300px" />
    </div>
    <div style="display: flex">
      <img src="images/6-6.png" style="max-height: 200px; max-width: 300px" />
      <img src="images/6-7.png" style="max-height: 200px; max-width: 300px" />
      <img src="images/6-8.png" style="max-height: 200px; max-width: 300px" />
      <img src="images/6-9.png" style="max-height: 200px; max-width: 300px" />
      <img src="images/6-10.png" style="max-height: 200px; max-width: 300px" />
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      Furthermore, we can see that for the sharp corners and edges of our
      meshes, they get smoothened out and become more round across the
      upsampling levels. This is expected as the algorithm basically
      interpolates vertex positions by fitting it onto the imaginary curved
      surface bounded by the surrounding vertices, which overall creates an
      smoothening effect. For a protruding vertex, it would be pushed inwards,
      and for a caved vertex, it would be pulled outwards. We can trace this
      back to the formulas for calculating the new positions for both new and
      existing vertices, where the sum of neighboring vertex positions directly
      influences the result. Consequently, one way to preserve sharpness is to
      make the neighbors closer to the vertex. Mathematically at the extreme
      end, we know that if all neighboring vertices are exactly at the same
      position as the vertex, then its position will not change at all.
      Therefore, as I have demonstrated below, by surrounding the corner vertex
      with a small cube of vertices, its position is "localized" and I was able
      to preserve its sharpeness.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div style="display: flex">
      <img src="images/6-11.png" style="max-height: 200px; max-width: 300px" />
      <img src="images/6-12.png" style="max-height: 200px; max-width: 300px" />
      <img src="images/6-13.png" style="max-height: 200px; max-width: 300px" />
      <img src="images/6-14.png" style="max-height: 200px; max-width: 300px" />
      <img src="images/6-15.png" style="max-height: 200px; max-width: 300px" />
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      Lastly, we can see from the previous examples that there seems to be some
      asymmetry when a mesh is upsampled. The reasoning behind this effect is
      basically the same as the one for the aforementioned loss of sharpness,
      where it came down to the distribution of neighboring vertices. As we can
      see from the graphic below, although both red and blue are both corners of
      a square and should therefore be symmetrical, their new positions will not
      be calculated the same way. This is because not only does red have one
      additional neighbor, but also one that is further along the diagonal than
      the rest.
    </div>
    <br />
    <img src="images/6-21.png" style="max-height: 400px; max-width: 600px" />
    <br />
    <div>
      Therefore, to eliminate this effect, we can simply preprocess the mesh so
      that the vertices that should be symmetrical have symmetrical neighbor
      distributions. As shown below, instead of constructing each face of the
      cube with two triangles, I used four, which makes every vertex have
      symmetrical neighbors, both in terms of their number and their positions.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div style="display: flex">
      <img src="images/6-16.png" style="max-height: 200px; max-width: 300px" />

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <div>
      Similar to project 1, this project reinforced a lot of ideas explained in
      lecture that I kinda just brushed through and did not get too familiar
      with. While this project for the most part is very straightforward, going
      through with the implementation of concepts such as 1D and 2D de Casteljau
      interpolation and 4-1 subdivision were still very beneficial to
      understanding the logic behind them. Moreover, trying to eliminate
      asymmetry or enforce corner sharpness also encouraged me to get behind why
      the upsampled meshes develop to be the way they are. The debugging was
      also certainly challenging due to errors in previous parts that I did not
      recognize. Overall, this project was great for learning and I enjoyed it a
      lot.
